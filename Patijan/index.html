                    <h3>Welcome to Desolve</h3>
                    <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of design and evolve, something we hope we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives who enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the cities we love. You'll also occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting on photography.</p>

                    <h3>So, what aren't we?</h3>
                    <p>Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here and want to participate, we'd love to have you. All galleries, articles and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.</p>

            <h3>Photographer's Rights</h3>
            <p>During the heightened security concerns around the country, it has become common to find photographers routinely harassed when taking photographs in public places. What are your rights as an amateur photographer? We will discuss what your rights are when taking photos in a public space. Following this information, we will have a panel discussion where you can ask specific questions, compare experiences, and become better informed as to what your rights are as an amateur photographer.</p>
            <p>The seminar will be held at the Charleston Gallery, 227 Meeting Street in Charleston on March 1st as part of the Engage lecture series.</p>
